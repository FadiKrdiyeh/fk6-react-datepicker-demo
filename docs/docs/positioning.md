It adapts to screen space and scroll behavior, ensuring the picker stays accessible and visually consistentâ€”no awkward overlaps or cut-offs. Perfect for responsive designs and polished UI interactions. -->

The calendar popup is designed for smart, responsive positioning that keeps it both accessible and visually consistent. You can control where it appearsâ€”above, below, beside, or aligned with the input fieldâ€”ensuring it fits naturally into your layout. Whether you're working with compact forms or spacious dashboards, the popup adapts to screen space and avoids awkward overlaps.
Even better, it stays anchored in view while scrolling. This sticky behavior ensures users donâ€™t lose access to the picker in long forms or scrollable containers, making interactions smooth and uninterrupted. Together, these features create a polished, user-friendly experience that feels intuitive across devices and layouts.
