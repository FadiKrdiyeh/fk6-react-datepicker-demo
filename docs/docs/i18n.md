# 🌍 Internationalization

The calendar supports full internationalization, adapting to local languages, date formats, digit systems, and layouts. It feels native across cultures, with automatic adjustments for locale-specific details like weekdays, meridiem, and right-to-left support.

## Change Calendar Locale

This example sets the Moment.js locale to Arabic ("ar") and renders a DatePicker with Arabic localization. It ensures that date formats, calendar labels, and UI elements appear in Arabic, providing a fully localized experience for Arabic-speaking users. You can configure any language you want!

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { DatePicker } from "@fk6/react-datepicker";

import "@fk6/react-datepicker/react-datepicker.css";
import "moment/locale/ar";

const Example = () => {
  return <DatePicker locale="ar" />;
};
```

## Disable Digits Localization
The `disableLocaleDigits` prop disables automatic localization of digits in the calendar and time picker. When enabled, it forces all numeric values—like days, months, years, hours, and minutes—to render using standard Western Arabic numerals (`0–9`), regardless of the user's locale.
This is especially useful when:
- You want consistent digit styling across all regions
- You're designing for international audiences but prefer a unified numeric format
- Your app’s branding or layout relies on fixed-width numerals or specific typography
It ensures clarity and visual consistency, especially in multilingual or cross-cultural interfaces.

```tsx
<DatePicker locale="ar" calendarProps={{ disableLocaleDigits: true }} />
```
